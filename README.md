# Secret Address

A better way to share your Bitcoin address. Secret Address is an open-source service which turns your Bitcoin wallets into webpages and embeddable widgets that instantly provide a one-time address whenever someone wants to send you Bitcoin.

Secret Address is not a payment processor for ecommerce. It is for those who don't need invoices, pre-defined amounts, email inputs, fiat calculations, countdowns, etc. Just instant access to a one-time Bitcoin address for sending a custom amount and nothing else. If you need an invoicing system, then consider using [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver).
